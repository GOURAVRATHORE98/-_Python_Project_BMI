The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator project in Python is an interactive health application designed to help individuals assess their body weight relative to their height. The script incorporates a user-friendly interface, prompting users to input their weight in kilograms and height in meters. To ensure data accuracy, the `get_valid_input` function validates user inputs, allowing for customization of input types and ranges. The program then employs the BMI formula (BMI = weight / (height^2)) to calculate the BMI with precision.

The BMI value is subsequently classified into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese using the `classify_bmi` function. This classification adds a valuable layer of interpretation to the numerical BMI result, providing users with a clear understanding of their body weight status.

The script's modularity enhances code readability and maintenance. The calculated BMI and its corresponding classification are presented to the user in a formatted message. The project fosters health awareness, encouraging users to monitor their BMI for a healthier lifestyle. By incorporating input validation and meaningful categorization, the BMI Calculator project delivers an efficient and informative tool for individuals interested in understanding and tracking their body weight in a simple and accessible manner.
